		<i>My skinny is the more special what i found
			<br>
			in  me live, i am very luck to have met her.<br><br><br>
			she is very importan in my life  i love the way he looks at me,the way he expresses himself towards me is  special with me,<br>
			she is my light in the darkest days, only she can be in my mind I don't have time for anyone else,
			I don't want her by my side, because <br>she is the sun that guides me;she's my skinny, the one who makes me call her at night because she's scared and doesn't want to be alone,<br> the woman who likes it when I bite her and hug her.She is afraid that they will make her suffer again, but she doesn't want me to leave,<br> she is more afraid of feeling alone again, that's why I want the best for both of us, I want to be with her when <br> she needs it. that. me, being there for her when she wants to cry and doesn't know what to do give you my unconditional<br> support when you feel like giving up.
